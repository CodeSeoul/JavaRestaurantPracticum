# Restaurant Practicum

This is a practicum for the Learn to Code Seoul Beginner Java course. See the completed branch for a completed version if you get really stuck, just try not to :)

Your objective is to solve all of the TODO items. If you use an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, it should recognize them for you, making navigating a little easier.

Recommended class order:
* [Ingredient](./src/main/java/org/l2csl/beginnerjava/restaurant/Ingredient.java)
* [Recipe](./src/main/java/org/l2csl/beginnerjava/restaurant/Recipe.java)
* [Dish](./src/main/java/org/l2csl/beginnerjava/restaurant/Dish.java)

You may also want to add print statements throughout so you can see what's happening.
