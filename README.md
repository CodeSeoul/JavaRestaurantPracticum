# Restaurant Practicum

This is a practicum for the Learn to Code Seoul Beginner Java course. See the completed branch for a completed version if you get really stuck, just try not to :)

Your objective is to solve all of the TODO items. If you use an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, it should recognize them for you, making navigating a little easier.
